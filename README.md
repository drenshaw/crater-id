# crater-id
Read a crater data file, create triads of craters with associated invariants, search database for matching triads based on images, then estimate the camera position using only the image for navigation. This is based on the work of Christian "Lunar Crater Identification in Digital Images" (2020) and my own work "Optical Navigation using Quadrics and Indirect Invariant Indexing" (2022).
