# crater-id
Read a crater data file, create triads of craters with associated invariants, search database for matching triads based on images, then estimate the camera position using only the image for navigation. This is based on the work of Christian "Lunar Crater Identification in Digital Images" (2020) and my own work "Optical Navigation using Quadrics and Indirect Invariant Indexing" (2022).

Starting with a set (3+) of identified craters on the lunar surface, we backproject the image ellipses to the disk quadrics which represent the crater rims. This backprojection gives the distance from the camera to the quadric, albeit with two possible orientations for the normal. Using the relationship between the know quadrics lets us choose the correct normals. With the quadrics known in both the camera and world frame, we can estimate (in the least squares sense) the camera's pose (position and orientation).
